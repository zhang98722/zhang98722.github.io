    <strong>CSAAs</strong>是用来制造
    <em>超旗和大航</em>的, 因此, 如果里面有东西在制造, 那就立马会变得非常有战略及价值, 但同时这东西也很脆弱.双方都出场了大型甲亢T3队伍，同时还有后勤舰，无畏，超旗和泰坦.</p>

  <p>各联盟在eve时间17：00开始集结,而战斗大概在18：43开始. 当战斗开始时星系里有超过
    <em>1370 玩家</em>.. 因为CCP没有在战前增强服务器节点，TiDi在战斗旗舰一直是最大状态(10%真实时间) . TiDi不仅影响了
    <span style="color: #008000;">
      <strong>SH1-6P</strong></span>星系,也影响到了附近的星系, 阻塞了双方后续增援队伍的进场.而战斗的核心的那个POS在前一天晚上（8月20日星期五）被Pandemic Legion打进增强（译者注：其实在战斗几天，我们在venal的预警就已经看到了NC有大量超旗和泰坦部署到那边了）.</p>

  <p>
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Northern Coalition</strong></span>的
    <em>甲亢T3</em>第一个到达现场, 直接跃迁到防御队伍的常规舰队前面打响了战斗的第一枪. 然后双方的舰队都被对方大量的alpha damage（DPH，集火攻击）破防直接击毁.
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Vanguard Coalition</strong></span>带着他们的
    <em>Tengu Fleet</em>随后也赶到, 
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Pandemic Horde</strong></span>过了好久才带领
    <em>Hurricanes</em>加入战斗.
    <br>
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Pandemic Legion</strong></span>很快带着他们的

    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Co2</strong></span>&nbsp;
    <em>POS</em>旁边入场, 离
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>NC</strong></span>&nbsp;的
    <em>常规队</em>相当远. 他们只能通过星门进入这个星系，因为这个星系被<span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Circle-Of-Two</strong></span>上了
    <strong>cyno&nbsp;jammed</strong>
    .&nbsp;然后，几个
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>PL</strong></span>的
    <em>后勤舰</em>跃迁到
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>NC</strong></span>&nbsp;
    <em>T3 Fleet</em>的遥修距离内, 提供了大量的遥修，降低了后续的损失. 防御方因为因为没有旗舰入场，失去了这些好处.</p>
  <p>在
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>PL</strong></span>的
    <em>超旗队</em>入场不久, 在
    <span style="color: #008000;">
      <strong>SH1</strong></span>的<strong>Cyno Jammer</strong>被下线, 让
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Circle-Of-Two</strong></span>能够投送他们的
    <em>旗舰和超旗力量</em>到
    <span style="color: #008000;">
      <strong>SH1</strong></span>的POS附近,但是离<span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>PL</strong></span>的
    <em>超旗队</em>好像有
    <strong>80-100 KM</strong>.
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Co2</strong></span>立即尝试用他们的末日武器击毁
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Pandemic Legion</strong></span>的
    <em>超旗队</em>. 然而,
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Co2</strong></span>在第一次集火的时候并没有击毁PL的
    <em>Nyx</em>.&nbsp;最终<span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>PL</strong></span>在<span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Circle-Of-Two</strong></span>投送他们的超旗舰队后很快击毁了<em>POS</em>.</p>

  <p>就在
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Co2</strong></span>投送了他们的
    <em>超旗队</em>不久,
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>TEST Alliance Please Ignore</strong></span>也投送了以<em>无畏</em>为主的
    <em>旗舰队</em>，也有几个
        <em>小航</em>加入. 他们很快开始清理<span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>PL</strong></span>用来支援常规的
    <em>后勤舰</em>.
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>NC</strong></span>投之以桃报之以李, 投送了他们自己的
    <em>超旗队</em>到常规队旁边, 就在
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>TEST</strong></span>的
    <em>无畏队</em>旁边. 
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>PL</strong></span>和
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>NC</strong></span>开始用末日武器扫射敌对的
    <strong>无畏</strong>，以免
    <em>后勤舰</em>被无畏团灭，打破了常规战的平衡.</p>
  <p>
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>TEST</strong></span>,还有其他的防御方决定不投入他们的超旗.
    <strong>Sapporo Jones</strong>,
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>TEST</strong></span>的CEO, 作了1个
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4yr294/gigx_on_sh1_battle/d6px4st">声明</a>&nbsp;说这是他下的不要投送

    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Snuffed Out</strong></span>和
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Project.Mayhem</strong></span>也拒绝投送他们的超旗.).

    <em>无畏队</em>打死的位置, 防御方最终输掉了这场战斗, 撤退的命令被下发，而
    <em>超旗队</em>被留在了战场. 防御方的超旗队切换目标开始击杀被用来阻止<span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Co2</strong></span>的<em>超旗队</em>撤退的
    <em>重拦</em>和
    <em>轻拦</em>. 1个
    <em>Ragnarok</em>被击杀之后, 防御方开始用尽全力将常规换成
    <em>隐轰</em>或者
    <em>指挥驱逐</em>来击毁困住
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Co2</strong></span>
    <em>超旗队</em>的泡泡, 而剩下的
    <em>T3</em>开始击杀战场上的
    <em>重拦</em>和
    <em>轻拦</em>.然而,
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>PL</strong></span>也全力继续困住泰坦, 一直从他们超旗舰队仓库放新的拦截.</p>
  <p>那天还有另外5个泰坦被干掉 – 总计2个 Avatars, 1个 Levi 和 3个 Ragnaroks , 而大多数
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>Co2</strong></span>的
    <em>常规队伍</em>逃过了这次屠杀. 他们的大航都在泰坦被击杀之前逃出来了.</p>
  <h3>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fleet Commanders Talk</span>:</h3>
  <p>Let’s have a chat with those that led the battle on both sides. Here’s
    <strong>
      <a href="https://evewho.com/pilot/Vily">Vily</a></strong>,&nbsp;Fleet Commander&nbsp;of
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>TEST</strong></span>‘s&nbsp;fleets during the battle, to give his perspective of the battle.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>My first question would be why did you chose to deploy T3s to the field, over another ship?
    <strong>
      <br>Vily:</strong>
    <em>If your expecting to be in a situation where you MUST fight under a hostile or supercapital umbrella you wanna go as low-sig as you can. HAW guns can still hit t3’s but not for the same devastating level of efficiency with which they hit battleships. T3 armor cruisers give the best balance of strength, tank and sig size for a fleet in that situation</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <br>Marcach:</strong>You said in a post on reddit explaining the situation with about TEST’s non-use of supers in the SH1 battle that there were several problems before the battle, particularly in relation to the communication between alliances. Could you explain a bit more?
    <strong>
      <br>Vily:</strong>
    <em>As far as communication goes, I would say the only issue we really had before the battle was just a general lack of strategic and tactical planning. We didn’t go over plans, opportunities or methods of attack for how we were going to execute the battle. As such when it happened we were just kind of playing blind in relation to our expectations from each other</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <br>Marcach:</strong>A lot was sacrificed by Co2 and TEST for that battle. Would you say it was completely in an attempt to save the tower and CSAA, or was there an element of “Sending a message”?
    <strong>
      <br>Vily:</strong>
    <em>Not particularily. While it ultimately ended in failure there is an element of needing to “stretch our legs” so to speak. Everyone wanted to fight and without the fervent desire by normal numerical standards there really shouldn’t have been a battle.</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <br>Marcach:</strong>Did you expect the battle to end the way it did?
    <strong>
      <br>Vily:</strong>
    <em>Once the Co2 Supers jumped in I expected them to all die. That the majority made it out was a pleasant surprise.</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <br>Marcach:</strong>What was your reaction when NC.’s super fleet jumped in far away from the POS on top of the subcap fight?
    <strong>
      <br>Vily:</strong>
    <em>well that wasn’t the subcap fight, that was co2’s Dreads they dropped on. I was a bit confused myself until I realized that the Co2 caps themselves were split. Part of the delay in us dropping anything was trying to figure out this as well, since in the middle of the fight and tidi sludge and bubbles its really hard to see them ;p</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <br>Marcach:</strong>How was the battle and it’s outcome generally received by TEST line members and leadership?
    <strong>
      <br>Vily:</strong>
    <em>fine. The dreads wanted to go in and had a blast (both figuratively and literally) although they were sad to get fully FAX buffered, the carriers got primaried pretty hard so were a little sad. And the supers could see the reality of the situation so were quite understanding of the decision</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <br>Marcach:</strong>Can you expect more battles like the one in SH1-6P to occur again during your fights against PL?
    <strong>
      <br>Vily:</strong>
    <em>no. Battles with PL possibly, but they have to be short and sweet with NC. at their back there is no force besides the Remains of goons WITH some significant help that would be able to hold them the fact that Pandemic horde, GOTG, Vanguard, Tri, and many more came to assist them is a dangerous precedent as well</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <br>Marcach:</strong>Looking back on the battle now, what would you have done differently? What have you learned from it?
    <strong>
      <br>Vily:</strong>
    <em>Probably tried to prevent Co2 from dropping supers/caps. look for a straggler on the gates we could surprise dreadbomb maybe. if I had to take the fight as was, I dunno</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <br>Marcach:</strong>Was there anything, other than the communication issues, that cause problems during the fight?
    <strong>
      <br>Vily:</strong>
    <em>not particularily. I know my computer crashed at one point that was certainly an inconvenience. The node not being reinforced added unnecessarily to the lag.</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <br>Marcach:</strong>Did you expect NC.’s super fleet to come in with PL, or did you expect them to be held in reserve like they were?
    <br>
    <strong>Vily:</strong>
    <em>was about what was expected, they waited at a mid and went in when the jammer was down when there was a reason for them to come in combined they had like 220 supercapitals so I don’t think they felt like they were expecting to see much action</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>What was the purpose of the carriers that came in with the Dread Bomb?
    <strong>
      <br>Vily:</strong>
    <em>to clear heavy fighters reduce incoming damage keeps the dreads alive longer</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach</strong>Do you have any comments to add?
    <br>
    <strong>Vily</strong>:
    <em>no that seems fine</em>
    <br>
    <strong>Marcach</strong>: Well, thank you Vily. I have no more questions at the moment. Thank you very much for your time.
    <br>
    <strong>Vily</strong>:
    <em>your welcome, have a great day</em></p>
  <p>I also had the chance to talk to
    <a href="https://evewho.com/pilot/Killah+Bee">
      <strong>Killah Bee</strong></a>of Pandemic Legion, who&nbsp;oversaw
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>PL</strong></span>‘s&nbsp;forces in
    <span style="color: #008000;">
      <strong>SH1-6P</strong></span>&nbsp;for his perspective of the fight.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>My first question would be what prompted Pandemic Legion’s aggression towards Co2 and TEST in recent weeks?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee</strong>:
    <em>Mainly to have fun. Now I know thats not something very exciting if you looking for any deeper reasons. But I guess my motivation was the way some parts of the TEST and Co2 leadership acted when we moved to hakonen. Nothing really strategic. We arent planning on taking vale or tribute we just wanna frag people.</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>Do you mind if I ask what exactly did Co2 and TEST’s leadership do to “nudge you” the wrong way? Though that your answer so far is great, thanks.
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>
    <em>So basically when we wanted to move to hakonen I got contacted by Vily who is one of the main FC’s in TEST and he told me he was gonna try everything to make my life a living hell “form a coalition” against me. Then they blobbed us on every timer with co2 and snuff / pm so I thought for my self aight lets see who can blob harder. Turns out people rather have a favor with pl than with test
      <img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="😉" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png"></em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>Undoubtedly PL will have known that Co2 had plans to drop their Super fleet on the tower you destroyed. Did you still expect them to drop after you came with your super fleet? (Noting that they had not preset up their Super fleet on the POS?)
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>
    <em>No. We saw their fleet logged in and I thought it was to scare us or something .. what people don’t seem to get is that logging in their supers / titans only gets us more exciting. So I was a little surprised when I saw them on grid. Happy but surprised.</em></p>
  <p>
    <b>Marcach:</b>Why did you chose to deploy T3 Cruisers against Co2, TEST, etc, rather than your other doctrines, like your rattlesnakes?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>
    <em>I was worried Test would bring Maelstroms which destroy rattlesnakes so I decided to stick to T3 cruisers as they are a little more ” all around “.</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>I’d like to ask about NC.’s Super fleet for a moment. The SH1 was cyno jammed, so PL’s super fleet came in via one of the gates. However, NC. only joined the fray after the Co2 deactivated the cyno jammer. Was this a planned idea to keep NC.’s super fleet on standby if the jammer came down, or what was the idea there?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>&nbsp;
    <em>yes we werent going to bring the NC fleet in if not needed</em>
    <br>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>But the arrival of Co2’s Dreads and Supers prompted them to join in?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>&nbsp;
    <em>yes</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>Did you expect Snuff/Project.Mayhem./TEST to join the fray with their supers?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>
    <em>yea maybe I am actually surpirsed they pussied out the 2nd time in a row
      <b>.</b>&nbsp;I dont believe snuff / pm will drop their supers into 0.0 until I see it. they are really risk averse.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>Right. Did you expect TEST to dread bomb? Did it have any effect on you/NC. ?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee</strong>:
    <em>Yes we were expecting the test dreads .. they didnt have too much effect except killing some fax. they just died really ^^</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>It seemed like you were almost saving your DD’s for them?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee</strong>:
    <em>yes ofc&nbsp;removing dreads is important they do a shit ton of dps / ehp</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>Do you think there would have been much of a difference in the battle had TEST, P.M./Snuff deployed their supers?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>
    <em>no we still would’ve won it would’ve taken longer and it would’ve been bloodier.</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>NC.’s subcap T3 fleet began the fight quite far away from the POS. What was the reasoning for this?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>
    <em>Mistakes were made. We wanted to fight on our super fleet</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>What effect did this have on the fight?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>
    <em>we won slower than we would’ve if we were closer together
      <img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="😉" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png">and it enabled them to clear tackle a little more efficient which is why “only” 6 titans died</em></p>
  <p>
    <b>Marcach:</b>Would you expect more battles like the one in SH1 to occur in your fight against Co2 and TEST? How about in the game as a whole since the capital changes?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>&nbsp;
    <em>I think we might see another battle like this .. co2 is very … stubborn and test has been waiting for their chance to f* us since we killed hero coalition so both are very keen. Well if you ask me about the capital I think they are awesome especially titans are super strong now but I have the luxury of beeing in a group that has loads of em so I think many will disagree especially the people that dont have a super fleet like us. I think the game is interesting atm .. lots is going on in eve since WWB. fights in the south, east, north now we have at coming up too and sitll activity pretty good I think its going to be an amazing winter.</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>How did the changes to capital movement, weapons, etc over the past few months affect the events leading up to, during, and the outcome of the battle?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>&nbsp;
    <em>I mean battles like this are very rare now days and I hope they will be around at all after poses are gone because citadel atm are way to hard to hit especially astrahuses. I think keepstars should be supers strong which they are, fortizars are okayish but astrahuses with their 3hrs vuln are way to hard to remove. Phoebe I think overall is fine just needs some tweaking maybe a little higher range or smth.</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>The change to capitals allowing them to take gates rather than forcing you to take down the cyno jammer as well must have been an interesting change?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>
    <em>Taking gates with supers is great yea</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>Otherwise my next question would be if you would mind imagining that you were in Co2/TEST’s position, and what you would have done differently?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>
    <em>Oh god thats a hard question. WHat would i have changed mhm. I wouldnt have escalated probably over all the odds just were against them. oh and IF I would have escalated I would have dropped all my supers / titans / dreads on one target and not spread over the entire grid. they got one nyx down to 22% armor with their DD volley if they wouldve had dreads to finish it off.</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>What was your reaction when Co2 dropped their Dreads so far from their supers?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>&nbsp;
    <em>I thought it was stupid. They brought them in to kill our apostles that were with the subcaps.</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>It was brought up during the Asher hour that there was a lot of trouble with aiming the new DDs. How did this affect the engagement?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>
    <em>Yea the UI is broken but CCP work on fixing that. Well aiming the new dd’s is pretty much impossible in a fight like that.</em></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Marcach:</strong>Thank you Killah Bee for you time.&nbsp;Do you have any comments you would like to add?
    <br>
    <strong>Killah Bee:</strong>&nbsp;
    <em>Nope thanks for having me.</em></p>
